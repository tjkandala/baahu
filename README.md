# baahu ðŸ’ª

## docs todo:

two types of documentation:

- baahu from first principles
- making an app with baahu

* optimized for modern js engines (hidden classes, etc. more monomorphic call sites, plus makes the code
  more consistent and easy to scan!)

// TODO: "persist to and hydrate from localStorage" flag on machines! then make TodoMVC

// TODO: localStorage recipe. this shouldn't be built in to the lib
