### TODO:

the first 3-4 sample apps that i make will be copied to this test folder.
while the other tests already give me 100% coverage, these apps will make sure
that baahu doesn't regress logically for complex applications. because this
is the goal of these tests, make these apps convoluted/push baahu to the limit!

include some basic contrived apps in 'basic.spec.tsx' that target specific code paths
